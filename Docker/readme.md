Docker Compose Configurations
This repository contains various Docker Compose file configurations that I have used on a range of projects at work and at home. These configurations were designed to address specific business needs, and to help me learn more about Docker, containerization, and other related technologies.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a particular service or container, such as mariadb, portainer, nginx, and so on. Each of these folders contains a Docker Compose file that describes the container and the services it provides. Additionally, each folder also contains a README file that provides additional information on the configuration, such as how to build and run the container, and how to configure and customize it.

These Docker Compose files are designed to be easy to use and customize, and should be a helpful resource for anyone looking to explore Docker and containerization. Whether you are a developer, a system administrator, or simply a curious learner, I hope that you find these configurations useful and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out!
