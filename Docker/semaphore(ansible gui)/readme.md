# Semaphore Docker Compose

This is a Docker Compose file that sets up an instance of Semaphore, a modern, open-source CI/CD tool for enterprise DevOps teams. It uses the Semaphore UI image from Docker Hub, along with a MySQL database container, for persistent storage.

## About Semaphore

Semaphore is a fast and easy-to-use continuous integration and delivery platform designed to optimize your DevOps workflows. It enables developers to easily build, test, and deploy their code to production without any additional effort. With Semaphore, teams can create custom pipelines that are tailored to their specific needs and automatically deploy new code changes to production as soon as they are ready. Semaphore is designed to work seamlessly with all popular programming languages and frameworks, including Ruby, Python, Java, Node.js, and many more. It also supports a wide range of cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

## Docker Compose Settings

### Networks

This Docker Compose file defines two networks:

-   `nginxproxymanager_default`: This network is an external network that is defined in another Docker Compose file. It is used to connect the Semaphore instance to the Nginx Proxy Manager.
    
-   `backend`: This network is used to connect the Semaphore instance to the MySQL database.
    

### Services

This Docker Compose file defines two services:

-   `mysql`: This service runs a MySQL database server that is used to store data for Semaphore. The service is connected to the `backend` network, which allows it to communicate with the Semaphore service.
    
-   `semaphore`: This service runs the Semaphore application itself. It is connected to both the `backend` and `nginxproxymanager_default` networks. The service is configured with environment variables that specify the database host, port, user, password, and database name, among other settings.
    

### Volumes

This Docker Compose file defines one volume:

-   `semaphore-mysql`: This volume is used to store the MySQL data for the Semaphore instance.
