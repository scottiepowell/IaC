# Terraform Projects for Civo, Cloudflare, Helm, Kubernetes, and Proxmox

Welcome to our collection of Terraform projects and resources for deploying resources using Civo, Cloudflare, Helm, Kubernetes, and Proxmox. This repository contains a folder with various examples that can be adapted to meet your specific use case.

## Technologies

### Civo

[Civo](https://www.civo.com/) is a UK-based developer-friendly cloud platform that provides managed Kubernetes clusters, VMs, and storage resources. It is ideal for building, deploying, and scaling cloud-native applications.

### Cloudflare

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is a web performance and security company that provides a range of services, including content delivery networks (CDNs), DNS management, and DDoS protection. It is an excellent choice for securing and accelerating your web applications.

### Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes. It is a popular tool for deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters.

### Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is a powerful platform for building and managing cloud-native applications.

### Proxmox

[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) is an open-source virtualization platform that allows you to create and manage virtual machines and containers. It is an excellent choice for creating a homelab or testing environment.

## Use Case: Homelab for Proxmox and Cloudflare

One potential use case for these Terraform projects is to create a homelab environment using Proxmox and secure it with Cloudflare. By using Terraform to manage the infrastructure, you can quickly spin up and tear down the environment as needed, without having to worry about manually provisioning and configuring the resources. This can save time and reduce errors, making it easier to experiment and learn.

## Examples

This repository contains a folder with various examples that can be adapted based on your use case. Feel free to explore the examples and use them as a starting point for your own projects. We hope you find these Terraform projects useful and look forward to hearing about your experiences using them.
