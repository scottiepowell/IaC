# Terraform Resources for Cloud Deployment with Civo and Cloudflare, Kubernetes Implementation, and Docker Example

This repository contains Terraform templates for three different scenarios: Cloud deployment with Civo and Cloudflare, Kubernetes implementation, and Docker example. Here's an overview of each scenario and its purpose.

## Cloud Deployment with Civo and Cloudflare

The cloud deployment template sets up a Civo instance and a Cloudflare DNS record, making your website or application accessible via your own domain name. The purpose of this template is to create a simple, scalable, and affordable infrastructure for your website or application.

Possible use cases for this template include hosting a simple website, running a blog, or deploying a small web application.

To install this template with Helm, create a `yourfile.auto.tfvars` file in the project directory and add your variables in it. The variables required for this template are `cloudflare_email`, `cloudflare_api_key`, and `civo_token`.

Once you have added your variables, run `terraform apply` to create the resources.

## Kubernetes Implementation

The Kubernetes implementation template creates a Kubernetes cluster using Civo, and sets up a Traefik ingress controller, a ClusterIssuer, and an NGINX deployment with SSL. The purpose of this template is to create a robust and scalable Kubernetes infrastructure that can be used to host web applications or websites.

Possible use cases for this template include hosting multiple web applications or websites, creating a high-availability infrastructure, or deploying a large-scale web application.

To install this template with Helm, create a `yourfile.auto.tfvars` file in the project directory and add your variables in it. The variables required for this template are `civo_token`, `cloudflare_email`, and `cloudflare_api_key`.

Once you have added your variables, run `terraform apply` to create the resources.

## Docker Example

The Docker example template creates a simple NGINX deployment with a single replica and a LoadBalancer service to expose it externally. The purpose of this template is to demonstrate how to use Terraform with Docker to create and deploy a containerized application.

Possible use cases for this template include experimenting with Docker and learning how to use Terraform to deploy containerized applications.

To install this template, run `terraform apply` to create the resources.

Note: This template requires the `kreuzwerker/docker` provider, which should be installed before running `terraform apply`.

Overall, these templates serve as a starting point for building scalable, reliable infrastructure using Terraform. With some customization and additional resources, these templates can be used to deploy complex and sophisticated web applications or websites.
