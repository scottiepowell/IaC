# Boilerplates for Automation and Deployment

Hello, these are my templates and configurations I use in various projects and deployment scenarios. They are based on automation and deployment tools such as Ansible, Docker, Terraform and much more.

I created these as resources to be extended and improved upon according to your specific use cases.  

### Warning

Please beware that numerous templates and scripts were developed for non-production and environments disconnected from the internet and will need adjusting to utilize for you needs.
