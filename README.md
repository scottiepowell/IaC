# Boilerplates for Automation and Deployment

Welcome to my collection of deployment templates and configurations for various projects. These templates and configurations are based on popular deployment and automation tools, including Ansible, Docker, Terraform, and more.  These resources are intended to serve as a foundation for your deployment needs, and can be extended and customized to meet your specific requirements. 

# Warning

Please note that some of the scripts and templates were designed for non-production and offline environments, so be sure to adapt them accordingly before using them in production environments.

Thank you for considering these templates for your deployment needs, and I hope you find them useful in your projects.
