This is an example Ansible playbook that performs several tasks related to user and SSH configuration. Here are some comments that describe each section of the playbook:

-   `hosts: ssh` - Specifies the hosts on which this playbook will run.
-   `vars:` - Defines a variable named `devops_password` and sets its value to `'devops'`.
-   `gather_facts: no` - Disables gathering of facts about the hosts.
-   `remote_user: scott` - Specifies the user to connect to the remote hosts as.
-   `become: true` - Enables privilege escalation to perform tasks as root.

The following tasks are executed on the remote hosts:

-   `name: Add a new user named devops` - Creates a new user named `devops` with a home directory of `/home/devops` and `/bin/bash` as the default shell.
-   `name: Add devops user to the sudoers` - Creates a new file at `/etc/sudoers.d/devops` with `devops` added to the list of sudoers.
-   `name: Deploy SSH Key` - Deploys the public key located at `/home/devops/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the remote host for the `devops` user.
-   `name: Disable Password Authentication` - Configures SSH to disable password authentication.
-   `name: Disable Root Login` - Configures SSH to disable root login.

Finally, the playbook defines a handler named `restart ssh` that restarts the SSH service when called.

To use this playbook, you can save it to a file with a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension, then run the `ansible-playbook` command to execute it on your hosts. You may also need to customize the variables and tasks to fit your specific needs.  

Here is an example of how i run the playbook.

"ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory.ini -l groupname"
