This script checks a file for non-ASCII and non-printable characters. It does this by first looking for any characters that are not in the ASCII range using the regular expression '[^\x00-\x7F]'. If any matches are found, the script will print a message indicating that the file contains non-ASCII characters. It then checks for non-printable characters using the regular expression '[^[:print:]]'. If any matches are found, the script will print a message indicating that the file contains non-printable characters.

To use this script, save it as a file (e.g. hash_check.sh), make it executable with chmod +x hash_check.sh, and then run it with ./hash_check.sh. Replace "hash_dump_file.txt" with the name of the file you want to check.

This script can be useful when you are working with files that should only contain ASCII or printable characters, such as Terraform files. If there is an issue with a file, this script can help you quickly identify the problem.

Example usage:

`./hash_check.sh`
