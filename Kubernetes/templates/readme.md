This repository contains kubernetes resources that can be used to deploy applications on kubernetes.

## Cert-manager.io Certificate

This resource is used to deploy a TLS certificate on a kubernetes cluster using [Cert-manager.io](https://cert-manager.io/docs/). It contains a set of instructions that can be used to configure a TLS certificate for a hostname.

## Kubernetes Deployment

This resource is used to deploy an application on a kubernetes cluster. A deployment specifies the number of replicas and a container specification. A container specification includes the image to use, the ports that the application listens to, and the storage that the application needs. The deployment also has a label which is used to match the deployment with the Kubernetes service.

## Kubernetes Ingress

This resource is used to define rules for how to route external traffic to Kubernetes services. An Ingress object contains a set of rules that map URLs to services. Each rule contains a set of paths that are mapped to a service.

## Kubernetes Namespace

This resource is used to create a new namespace in a kubernetes cluster. Namespaces are used to isolate resources in a kubernetes cluster.

## Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim

This resource is used to request a persistent volume from a storage class. A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is used to allocate storage resources for a deployment. The PVC specifies the storage resources that are needed and the storage class that should be used.

## Kubernetes Service

This resource is used to create a Kubernetes service. The service exposes the deployment and provides a stable IP address and port for accessing the application. The service can be configured to have different types, such as ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer, depending on the use case.

## Execution

To use these resources, first ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster set up with the necessary components installed, such as Cert-manager.io. Then, apply the resources to your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command.

## Possible use cases

These resources can be used for deploying different applications on Kubernetes, such as web applications or microservices. The Cert-manager.io Certificate resource can be used to enable HTTPS for an application, while the Kubernetes Service resource can be used to provide a stable IP address and port for accessing the application.

The Kubernetes Namespace resource can be used to separate different environments, such as development, staging, and production. The Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim resource can be used to allocate storage resources for a deployment, and the Kubernetes Deployment resource can be used to deploy the application on Kubernetes.

## Conclusion

These resources are useful for deploying applications on Kubernetes, and can be used in different use cases. They can help to enable HTTPS for an application, provide a stable IP address and port for accessing the application, allocate storage resources for a deployment, and deploy the application on Kubernetes.
